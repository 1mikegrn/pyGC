# Gas Chromatography and Data Functionalization in Python

This GitHub repository is designed to have multiple functions:

- Act as a Binder host
- Act as a data/code repository for JCE supplemental
- pip installation for pyGC

# Binder

First, this repository includes an example jupyter notebook which is
linked to binder, which allows for demonstration without any necessary
installations. To use, simply press the 'Binder' button at the top of
this doc. To note, this notebook takes several minutes to spin up, so
plan accordingly if you choose to use it in presentation.

# Supplemental Files

Secondly, this repository includes as a file directory the contents of
the JCE manuscript supplemental files. That directory can be downloaded
using the following link:

[JCE-Supplemental](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/1mikegrn/pyGC/tree/master/JCE-supplemental)

# pyGC

Finally, this repository hosts the pyGC module, which can be installed
into python using pip ang git:

    pip install git+https://github.com/1mikegrn/pyGC
    
once installed, the application can be run by opening your python
terminal and running:

    pyGC-init
