just a bunch of text which renders in the help popup - rst option in kivy is
buggy, check back to see if/when it's working so this can be done nicer.

        Input Data can be placed into either a Microsoft Excel 
        (.xlsx) file, a comma-separated .csv file, or a tab-separated .csv 
        file, as a X by 2 array, using columns (1, 2) for the (x, y) data 
        columns derived from experiment. Text above and below the data will 
        be automatically filtered out by the program. There is no restriction 
        on the number of rows utilized for calculation. Locate the file using 
        the built-in file explorer and click 'select'.

        Once the GC data has been loaded into the graphing window, click the 
        (x, y) points where you would like to 'guess' there is a gaussian 
        distribution. The program will automatically attempt fit one gaussian 
        distribution to the data set for each point which is picked on the 
        graphing canvas. The points do not need to be selected perfectly, 
        though there is a higher probability of finding the global minimum 
        as your guess is made more accurate. Should you wish to delete any 
        points, the button 'clear last object' will remove the most recently 
        placed point from the graph. If you wish to start over, you can clear 
        the graph entirely by selecting 'clear graph'.

        Once the program is finished deconvoluting the data set a graph will 
        appear showing the deconvoluted gaussian distributions and the 
        associated integral areas.

        Once the deconvolution is finished, the graph options window will open 
        allowing the user to adjust the graph as necessary using the built-in 
        buttons which move the plot Up/Down and Left/Right, as well as 
        Expand/Contract along both axes. Adjusting the 'Sensitivity' slider 
        adjusts the magnitude to which each button press adjusts the graph. 
        The 'Center' button returns the graph to the space which the imported 
        data occupies. Once the graph looks as desired, press the 'Export graph 
        to Image' button to save the graph as a .png image. This image will be 
        saved to the file location of the input data. The user can also export 
        the graph data to an excel file by pressing 'Export data to Excel'.

        The user has the option of selecting between two fitting

        distribution skewing.
